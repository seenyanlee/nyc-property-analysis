# nyc-property-analysis
This project was done as part of my application to Data Analytics Consultancy Network (DACN)'s Data Science focused technical assessment in August 2021. 
The description of the project is as follows (provided by DACN):

_AeirB&C is an online hub for rental spaces. With economy reopening and travel picking up, AeirB&C is looking to reopen. AeirB&C has recently invested in a new marketing drive for their properties in New York to support their recovery from the pandemic, led by their marketing director, Mahkehtin. Mahkehtin has asked DACN, using their pre-pandemic dataset, to help with understanding:
Their current presence around New York
Their marketable population
The quality of the properties listed, as proxied by the number of reviews_

_You have been tasked with analysing the above datasets to create visualisations and draw insights to answer the Mahkehtinâ€™s concerns. _

_You may conduct limited desktop research and make reasonable, clearly stated assumptions to aid your analysis._

The datasets used are provided by DACN.

The visualisations and datasets produced by the code can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hupoP244TmcOleBHQs9aTl-2VjkjNUU-?usp=sharing
